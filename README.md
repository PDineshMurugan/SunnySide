## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of responsive design principles. I learned to use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a flexible layout that adapts to various screen sizes. Additionally, I gained experience in implementing hover states for interactive elements, enhancing user experience.

### Continued development

Going forward, I want to focus on improving my JavaScript skills, particularly with state management in React. I also plan to explore more about accessibility best practices to ensure my projects are usable for everyone.
